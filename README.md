## About

BotBlock's goal is to provide a modern, privacy-respecting, CAPTCHA solution, to mitigate the harm that can be caused by bots. Unlike traditional CAPTCHA's, BotBlock is meant to be self-hosted, and does not reply on any type of traffic analysis: it provides a simple challenge and response.

BotBlock is for websites that do not wish to send user data to third parties, and are looking for an easy-to-implement solution. BotBlock is written in Python, and designed for use with Django.

BotBlock's efficiency will vary greatly, depending on server hardware and user specifications. However, one can expect BotBlock to be capable of generating around 200 CAPTCHA's per second, when running on a single core ~3.0GHz CPU.
